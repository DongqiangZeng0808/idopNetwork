Most existing approaches for network reconstruction can only infer an overall network 
	and, also, fail to capture a complete set of network properties. To address these issues, 
	a new model has been developed, which converts static data into their 'dynamic' form. 
	'idopNetwork' can inferring informative, dynamic, omnidirectional and personalized networks.

## Installation

You can install the development version of idopNetwork from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cxzdsa2332/idopNetwork")
```
